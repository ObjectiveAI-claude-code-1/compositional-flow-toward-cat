Determine whether the visual elements of the photograph create compositional flow toward the cat. Trace the paths the viewer's eye would naturally follow through the image — paths shaped by lines, edges, contrasts, light gradients, and areas of visual interest — and assess whether those paths converge on the cat. Look for leading lines such as floorboards angling inward, shelves or surfaces terminating at the subject, or light brightening toward the cat's face that create a sense of compositional inevitability — a feeling that every element in the photograph is quietly pointing at the subject. Identify cases where the flow works against the subject: the eye drifting to a bright window in a corner, following a diagonal that leads away from the cat, or bouncing between competing focal points with no resolution. The goal is to determine whether the visual architecture of the photograph — its geometry, tonal structure, and arrangement of shapes — generates a current that draws the viewer naturally and effortlessly toward the cat, making it not just present in the image but central to its visual gravity. Score high when lines, light, and spatial geometry converge on the cat with a feeling of inevitability. Score low when the eye wanders, is pulled away from the subject, or finds no coherent path toward the cat.
