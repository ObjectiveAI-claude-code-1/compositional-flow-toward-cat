# Compositional Flow Toward Cat

## Purpose

Every photograph tells the eye where to go. Before a viewer consciously registers the subject, their gaze has already been caught, carried, and deposited somewhere in the frame by forces they rarely think about — the angle of a banister, the gradient of afternoon light across a wall, the sharp edge where a dark bookshelf meets a pale floor. These forces constitute compositional flow: the invisible current running through an image that determines not just what the viewer sees, but how they arrive at it.

The purpose of this function is to evaluate whether that current leads to the cat. Not whether the cat is visible, not whether it is centered or large or in focus, but whether the silent architecture of the photograph — its lines, its light, its spatial structure — conspires to deliver the viewer's eye to the subject with a feeling of inevitability. A cat can sit in the middle of a frame and still feel incidental if every visual force in the image is pulling elsewhere. Conversely, a cat half-hidden in the corner of a room can feel like the destination the entire image was built to reach, if the geometry and light are working in its favor.

This function receives a single input: a photograph containing a cat. The photograph may be of any style, setting, or quality. It may be a carefully composed portrait or a casual snapshot taken in haste. The setting may be a sunlit kitchen, a cluttered desk, an alleyway, or a garden. What matters is not the content of the scene but the visual relationships within it — the way elements are arranged relative to one another and, crucially, relative to the cat. The function reads the image not as a story about a cat but as a map of visual forces, and it asks a single question: do those forces converge on the subject?

The use-cases for this function are rooted in the difference between a photograph where a cat happens to appear and a photograph that is compositionally about the cat. A photographer curating a portfolio wants to know which of their images possess that magnetic quality — the ones where the room itself seems to be looking at the cat. A content platform ranking cat photography benefits from distinguishing images with genuine visual pull from those that are merely adequate. A tool for photographic education could use this function to show learners how composition shapes the viewer's experience, illustrating the difference between an image where the eye settles and one where it drifts. In each case, the function provides a score that captures something subtle and often felt but rarely articulated: whether the photograph's visual architecture serves its subject.

## Three Qualities

### 1. Linear Convergence

The first quality to evaluate is whether the lines and edges present in the photograph converge on the cat. Every environment is full of lines — the edges of floorboards, the seams of tiles, the rails of a staircase, the horizon where a tabletop meets a wall, the diagonal of a cast shadow. These lines are among the most powerful compositional tools in photography because the human eye follows them involuntarily. A line does not ask permission; it simply leads.

Linear convergence asks whether those lines lead toward the cat. Consider a hallway photograph where the baseboards on both sides angle inward toward a vanishing point, and a cat sits precisely at that point of convergence. The eye has no choice but to travel down those lines and arrive at the subject. Or consider a kitchen counter whose edge runs diagonally from the lower left of the frame toward a cat perched at its far end — the line serves as a runway delivering attention directly to the subject. These are cases of strong linear convergence.

Now consider the opposite. A cat sits on a rug, but the dominant lines in the image — the edge of a staircase, the stripe of light from a window — angle away from it, pulling the eye toward an empty corner. The lines and the subject are in disagreement. The photograph contains a cat, but its geometry is pointing somewhere else. This is weak or adverse linear convergence, and the function must recognize it.

The evaluation considers not just whether lines exist but whether they participate in a coherent directional system that terminates at the cat. Parallel lines that pass by the subject without engaging it are neutral. Lines that radiate outward from the cat, as if the subject were the origin point of the image's geometry, are powerful. The function traces these paths and assesses whether the linear structure of the photograph is working for the subject or against it.

### 2. Tonal Pull

The second quality is whether the distribution of light, brightness, and contrast in the photograph creates a gravitational pull toward the cat. Light is attention. The human eye is drawn to the brightest area in a scene, to the point of highest contrast, to the place where luminance shifts most dramatically. Tonal pull asks whether those bright points, those zones of contrast, cluster around the cat or scatter elsewhere.

A photograph where warm light falls across a cat's face while the surrounding room sits in soft shadow has strong tonal pull. The light is doing the work of composition — it is saying, without lines or geometry, that this is where you should look. Similarly, a high-contrast cat — a dark subject against a light background, or a bright subject against a dark one — naturally attracts the eye because contrast is a signal of visual importance. The tonal structure of the image is pulling the viewer inward, toward the subject.

Weak tonal pull occurs when the light competes with the subject rather than supporting it. A bright window blazing in the background while the cat sits in relative dimness creates a tonal hierarchy where the cat loses. A sunlit patch on the floor that is brighter than the cat itself becomes a false destination — the eye goes there first and may never fully commit to the subject. Multiple areas of high contrast scattered across the frame create tonal noise, a condition where the eye bounces between bright spots without settling, and the cat becomes just one of several candidates for attention rather than the clear winner.

The function evaluates whether the tonal landscape of the photograph — its gradients, its peaks of brightness, its zones of contrast — slopes toward the cat. When light brightens as it approaches the subject, when contrast peaks at the cat and softens elsewhere, when the tonal architecture of the image creates a kind of visual gravity well centered on the subject, the score should reflect that coherence. When light and contrast scatter attention or actively pull it away, the score should reflect that too.

### 3. Focal Resolution

The third quality is whether the spatial arrangement of visual elements in the photograph resolves at the cat — whether the eye's journey through the image has a clear destination, and whether that destination is the subject. An image is full of objects, textures, colors, and shapes, each competing for attention to some degree. Focal resolution asks whether this competition has a winner, and whether the winner is the cat.

Strong focal resolution means the photograph has a clear visual hierarchy. The cat is the terminus of the eye's journey. Other elements in the frame — furniture, patterns, objects — may be interesting, but they serve supporting roles, stepping stones that the eye touches briefly on its way to the subject. The viewer's gaze may enter the frame at a bright wall, travel along a shelf, and come to rest on the cat at the end of it. The journey has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and the end is the subject. There is a sense of arrival, a feeling that the visual exploration of the image concludes naturally and satisfyingly at the cat.

Weak focal resolution occurs when the image presents competing destinations with no clear hierarchy. A vase of flowers on the left is as visually compelling as the cat on the right. A patterned rug beneath the cat is so busy and detailed that the eye gets stuck in it rather than moving through it. A second animal in the background splits the viewer's commitment. In these cases, the eye wanders without settling, or it settles on something other than the cat, or it oscillates between two or more candidates without resolution. The image has no compositional conclusion. The cat is present but not prioritized.

The function assesses whether the spatial composition resolves. It looks at how many competing focal points exist, how strongly they compete with the cat, and whether the overall arrangement guides the eye toward the subject or leaves it adrift. A photograph with strong focal resolution feels calm and purposeful — the viewer knows where to look and feels satisfied looking there. A photograph with weak focal resolution feels restless — the eye searches for a home and does not find one, or finds one that is not the cat.

## Conclusion

These three qualities — linear convergence, tonal pull, and focal resolution — are the pillars of compositional flow. A photograph may excel in one and fail in another. An image with powerful leading lines but flat, even lighting will guide the eye along a path but without urgency. An image with beautiful tonal pull but chaotic geometry will attract the eye to the right region but through a disorienting journey. The highest scores belong to photographs where all three forces align — where the lines point at the cat, the light falls on the cat, and the spatial arrangement resolves at the cat — creating that rare and satisfying feeling that the entire image exists in service of its subject, that every element in the frame is quietly, inevitably, pointing at the cat.
