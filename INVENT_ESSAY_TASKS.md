1. Trace the lines and edges present in the photograph — floorboards, shelves, railings, shadows, architectural seams, surface boundaries — and determine whether they form a directional system that converges on the cat. Assess whether the dominant lines lead the eye toward the cat, pass by it without engaging it, or angle away from it toward other areas of the frame. Score this quality highly when the lines create a coherent geometry that terminates at the cat, as if the environment's structure is pointing at the subject, and score it low when the lines pull the eye elsewhere or offer no directional relationship to the cat at all.

2. Evaluate the distribution of light, brightness, and contrast across the photograph and determine whether the tonal landscape creates a gravitational pull toward the cat. Identify where the brightest areas fall, where contrast peaks, and where luminance shifts most dramatically, then assess whether those tonal landmarks cluster around the cat or scatter to competing regions of the frame. Score this quality highly when light brightens toward the cat, contrast peaks at the subject and softens elsewhere, and the tonal structure makes the cat the most visually magnetic point in the image, and score it low when bright windows, sunlit patches, or other high-contrast zones pull the eye away from the subject or create tonal noise that prevents the eye from settling.

3. Assess whether the spatial arrangement of all visual elements in the photograph resolves at the cat — whether the eye's journey through the image has a clear destination and that destination is the subject. Identify competing focal points such as colorful objects, busy patterns, other animals, or visually striking areas, and determine whether they serve as supporting waypoints on the path to the cat or as rival destinations that split the viewer's attention. Score this quality highly when the photograph has a clear visual hierarchy with the cat at its summit, giving the viewer a sense of arrival and satisfaction, and score it low when the eye wanders without settling, oscillates between competing elements, or finds a resting place that is not the cat.
